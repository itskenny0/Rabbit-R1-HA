 * fields are optional and depend on the integration that produced the
 * event. We carry every field nullable rather than coercing to defaults
 * so the UI can suppress chrome (entity-id label, domain accent) when
 * the underlying event doesn't include it.
 *
 * @Stable so the LazyColumn item in [LogbookScreen] can skip
 *  recomposition when the row reference is unchanged across a refresh.
